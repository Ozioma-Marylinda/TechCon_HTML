          <h1>History of TECHCON</h1>
          <p>
            TECHCON, hosted by the <strong>Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)</strong>, has long served as a premier gathering of the brightest minds in semiconductor research and development. Since its inception in the early 1980s, the event has grown to become a vital bridge between academic innovation and industry demand.
          </p>

          <h2>Beginnings in the 1980s</h2>
          <p>
            TECHCON was launched shortly after SRC's founding in 1982, during a period when the U.S. semiconductor industry faced stiff global competition. SRC was created to help unify efforts between universities and industry to accelerate progress.

          <h2>Expanding Research Impact</h2>
          <p>
            Through the 1990s and 2000s, TECHCON became a showcase for cutting-edge research in materials, device scaling, and electronic design automation. The event featured collaborative projects funded by SRC and highlighted technologies that would go on to influence global chip production.

          <h2>Modernization and Diversity</h2>
          <p>
            In recent years, TECHCON has embraced broader themes such as <em>artificial intelligence, quantum computing, sustainability, and workforce development</em>. With over 50% participation from women and underrepresented groups in 2024, the conference reflects SRCâ€™s mission to build an inclusive future for the semiconductor industry.

          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            With TECHCON 2025 already scheduled for September in Austin, Texas, the legacy continues. The conference is not only a hub for technological exchange but also a talent pipeline that helps shape the future of electronics.
